COMPILING

If you are compiling from source you will need several third party libraries:
freetype2, jbig2dec, libjpeg, openjpeg, and zlib. These libraries are contained
in the source archive. If you are using git, they are included as git
submodules.

You will also need the X11 headers and libraries if you're building on Linux.
These can typically be found in the xorg-dev package. Alternatively, if you
only want the command line tools, you can build with HAVE_X11=no.

The new OpenGL-based viewer also needs OpenGL headers and libraries. If you're
building on Linux, install the mesa-common-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev packages.
You'll also need several X11 development packages: xorg-dev, libxcursor-dev,
libxrandr-dev, and libxinerama-dev. To skip building the OpenGL viewer, build
with HAVE_GLFW=no.

DOWNLOAD

The latest development source is available directly from the git repository:

	git clone https://github.com/cgogolin/penandpdf.git

In the penandpdf directory, update the third party libraries:

	git submodule update --init
